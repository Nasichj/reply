# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> Learning the library was not as easy as I anticipated. Though most functions and variables were self-explanatory (in their naming), 
lack of comments with each function made it difficult to understand what is going on. Yet, I have applied the information I got from 
the class reading and used all resources available to me. In addition to following the instruction that recommends making a 
temporary .js file to test out features and write example files, reading the README.md file that the author included in the files 
helped in learning the library. Running the library definitely helped in learning the library. 

##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
>When explaining to a new CS142 student how to write effective comments, I will tell him/her not to go deep into how a piece of code 
works rather give a high level over view of what it does in a very straight and concise sentence or in couple of phrases. This is because 
going deep into detail scares away the reader and make it unnecessarily complicated. So ‘Raising the level of abstraction’ may mean avoid 
specific details (should remain abstract/hidden) and focus on describing the more complex whole that can give the wholesome or overarching picture. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent considerably many hours on this assignment (12-15 or may be more-didn't track it well). Reading through the read me, writing examples, 
figuring out how it works, commenting and doing the write up required more time than anticipated.

##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
>  No, but asked TA's (Eden and Sophie) questions on a problem i faced in installing jsdoc

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> We can always benefit from more detailed instruction especially in potential problem we may face (e.g. installing jsdoc issues or things of that sort)
